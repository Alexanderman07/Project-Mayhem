## Project Description
  Project Mayhem is a single-player, text based rpg set in UCR. In the game, you play as a student who is tasked with taking down all of the departments and making the BCOE college the best department at UCR. With the help of your mentor, Professor N, you must navigate through UCR and take down students from opposing colleges. 
 
  The project that we have chosen is interesting to us because we all enjoy rpg games and we have never done a project around a game before. 
  
  We plan to create the project using C++ and do all of our development using Vim within UCR’s hammer server. On top of that, we will be using Git and GitHub which will allow us to work as a team and collaborate on the development of our project.
  
  The input for the project will be designated keys to interact with the text prompts. As a user of our project, you would be able to create a character to your own liking. The output of the project will be more text prompts that will allow for further input and progression in the game. Our RPG game will feature a campus like setting where the user can progress and “battle” other departments. If given enough time, we would like to go ahead and add visuals and graphics to our final game.

 **Diagram Description:**

The class diagram depicts the core classes and features of Project Mayhem. As an RPG, the game will focus mainly on you, the player. A player will have access to 4 attribute categories: Luck, Strength, Health, and IQ. These attributes will affect how you engage in combat. Players will be able to level up their attribute points as they progress through the game. You will have freedom to travel to different areas of the map to progress the story, buy/sell items, or engage in optional content. Your attributes will determine how you combat the game’s enemies. The foes you face in Project Mayhem will vary in strengths based on their school affiliation.

## Design Pattern: 
We chose to implement the composite design pattern for our Enemy classes. We chose this pattern because we are most familiar with this design pattern. The original concept of the “Enemy” seemed to align with the principles of the composite design pattern. This design pattern helped us write better code because it encourages us not to reuse code.

 ## Installation/Usage
 All the user needs to do to install the game is to hit the run button located at the top right corner of the screen on replit. Users will be prompted to enter in a name, first name or first and last name, and a category type they would like to use for the entirety of the game. During battle, five action options will be given to the player to interact with the game during a battle against a grunt and an enemy boss. After the player's first encounter with an enemy grunt, they will have the option to explore different buildings at UCR and buy items they will need for battle using the '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', and '7' number keys. Also 'B', 'Y', 'N', 'M', 'S', and 'T' may be used when prompted.
